# OpenGL

This will be one of the last changes I make to this repository...

This project can serve as a basis for understanding computer graphics I have commented it (mostly) so with any prior code knowledge you should hopefully understand whats going on xD
    If you're reading this and want me to explain any of the code or want to know which books/videos I followed to create this just email me or message me on fb - have fun xD
